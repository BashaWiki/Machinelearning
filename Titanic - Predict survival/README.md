# Welcome to Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
## Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics

### Short Description of the project

> In this project we are going to predict who are all has survived on the Titanic Disaster using different types of Classifier algorithms and calculating Confusion matrix and Accuracy score for each classifiers applied in the model.

*Please find the full description and problem statement of this in the below link: [Titanic Competetion Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)* 

***<ins>Pre-requiste <ins>:*** 
1. Install python
2. Make sure numpy,pandas and Scikit learn is installed (pip install numpy)
3. Please use Jupyter notebook(Install in local) or [Google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run this code


### Classifier algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- KNN Clasifier
- SVR Classifier
- Random Forest Classifiers
